# 数据库表

Hi.  Does anybody have documentation regarding what these tables are for?  I've looked online, but cannot find it.

what they are for:


* aliases: fs_cli command aliases
* calls: list of currently active calls for show calls
* channels: list of currently active channels for show channels
* complete: tab complete data for fs_cli
* db_data: for the db application data storage
* group_data: for the group command data storages
* interfaces: for the show interfaces command
* nat: active nat mappings
* recovery: state data for call recovery
* registrations: central data repo for storing registration data
* sip_authentication: storage of sip nonce info
* sip_dialogs: sip current dialog info, used for presence
* sip_presence: used for presence state
* sip_registrations: used for data for active sip reg
* sip_shared_appearance_*: used for another kind of sip presence
* sip_subscriptions: to store active subscriptions
* tasks: for the task scheduler
